# Arculator WASM

This is a fork of the Arculator Acorn Achimedes emulator, with tweaks that allow it to be compiled to WebAssembly using Emscripten and run in a web browser.

It is currently a work in progress. The compiled Arculator code works mostly flawlessly, but work remains to be done on the web UI to make it more useable.
